xkcd4me is a Python3 script that manages the downloading and viewing
of xkcd comics. (Unfamiliar? Let's change that: http://xkcd.com)

DEPENDENCIES 
------------
- xkcd4me works on Linux, OSX, and Windows using Cygwin.
- You need Python3.1 or later.
- You also need httplib2. Get it here:

RUNNING XKCD4ME
---------------
- Run xkcd4me.py on the command-line as:
    xkcd4me.py
  to open an interactive prompt. 
- Additional arguments can be passed on the command-line. Saying:
    xkcd4me.py n
  will download the lastest comic.

    xkcd4me.py 234
  will open (or download first) comic #234.

    xkcd4me.py 45-90
  will download comics 45 to 90, provided you don't have them already.

    xkcd4me.py all
  will download all the comics that you don't have. ALL of them.

    xkcd4me.py r
  will open (or download) *a random comic*.

    xkcd4me.py wipe
  will clear your cache and delete all the comic image files.

    xkcd4me.py ls
  will display all the comics you have.

    xkcd4me.py head
  will display your first ten comics.

    xkcd4me.py tail
  will display your last ten comics.

USING THE PROMPT
----------------
- Follow the instructions given to you while running the script.
- All the commands written above are also available in the prompt,
  so using certain commands over and over is a bit easier,
  *especially 'r', the command that brings up a random comic for your 
  viewing pleasure*.

ABOUT XKCD4ME'S INTERNET CONNECTION
-----------------------------------
- The script will attempt to connect to the xkcd servers upon being run.
  If it fails, no internet dependant functions will be available until
  an internet connection is completed and the script is restarted.
- Note that if while using the script through its prompt a connection is made,
  the script will not detect this until it has been restarted.
